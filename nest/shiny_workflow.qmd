Development cycle (creating apps, making changes, experimenting with the results)

Steps: 

1. write some code
2. launch the app with short-cut: `cmd/ctrl + shift + enter` (source)
3. interactively experiment with the app
4. close app, go back to 1.


Create the app with the following lines:

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
)
server <- function(input, output, session){
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```
